			<h4>Entering Keywords For Your Profile</h4>
			<p style="font-size: 16px; text-align: justify; color: grey;">Entering keywords is simple yet important to allow potential customers, business partners, and interested people to search and find your profile. The keywords you may enter are unlimited and not displayed. Therefore, feel free to include what you think best describes your products or services and enter every keyword phrase per line. For example, if you own a restaurant serving French cuisine in California, a few keyword phrases could be:</p>

			<ul style="list-style: none;">
				<li>California</li>
				<li>Los Angeles</li>
				<li>French Cuisine</li>
				<li>Fine Dining</li>
				<li>Full Service</li>
			</ul>
