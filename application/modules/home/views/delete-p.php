			<h4>Deleting Your Profile</h4>
			<p style="font-size: 16px; text-align: justify; color: grey;">If you think you will not benefit from including your product or service profile with Chat Fact, you can permanently delete your profile from the directory. This will allow no option for recovery as you cannot regain access to your deleted profile, and potential customers, business partners, or interested people will not be able to search or contact you. This however excludes information that has been stored with others such as through chats. If you wish to proceed to permanently delete your profile, <a href="<?php echo base_url().'home/help/deletecard' ?>" style="color: blue;">click here</a>.</p>
